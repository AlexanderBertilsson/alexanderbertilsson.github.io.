                <p>Sweden is a hub of competitive gaming, yet for many Warhammer 40,000 players, the path to greatness in the teams context is often a dead end. If the goal is to play in a highly competitive environment, applying for the National Team and ultimately WTC is the path to take. The problem is that there is a limited number of spots available, and competition is hard, leaving talented individuals frequently overlooked‚Äînot for a lack of skill, but because the current ecosystem doesn‚Äôt have room for them. The other path is to play in team events organized by individual clubs throughout the country, and while this is a fun way to experience 40k in its own way, what's lacking is the larger context and continuity. This is the vacuum we want to fill.</p>
                <p>We believe team play is the most enjoyable way to play 40k and every team and player with a passion for the game deserves a real shot at the top. We're here to change the ad-hoc nature of Swedish 40K and give teams the larger context they deserve. We want to build an arena where your hard work and dedication can lead to tangible results and recognition.</p>
